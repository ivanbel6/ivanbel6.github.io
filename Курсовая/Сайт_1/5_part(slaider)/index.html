                        <h2>The main advantages of wood are:</h2>
                        <ul class="sps">
                            <li>Ecological friendliness</li>
                            <li>Durability</li>
                            <li>Long service life</li>
                            <li>Easy repair.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Specialists try to make maximum use of the positive qualities of wood materials, reduce the negative factors affecting them, and ensure economically efficient use of wooden structures. Most of the natural disadvantages of wood materials can be eliminated or significantly limited in their impact on the quality of wooden buildings. For example, CLT eliminates the problem of limited wood assortment, the use of sheet materials based on wood (plywood, MDF, particleboard) reduces the effect of anisotropy in the structure of wood materials. Structural and chemical protection methods reduce the risk of decay and fire of wooden structures.</p>

                        <h1>Brick</h1>
                        <p>The main advantages of a brick house are its high strength. In terms of load-bearing capacity, a wall built from this type of building material is almost as strong as a concrete one. Such characteristics are ideal for low-rise suburban construction as well as for the construction of high-rise buildings. In addition, a brick house will not burn, rot, or shrink.

                            However, in terms of energy efficiency, walls made of ceramic or silicate bricks significantly lag behind other building materials. In order to provide sufficient energy efficiency for a private home, a brick wall must have a minimum thickness of 120 cm. It becomes clear that no one will build a "bunker" with such walls for permanent year-round living, so today brick is increasingly used as a facing material.</p>

                        <h1>Gas and foam blocks</h1>
                        <p>Gas and foam blocks have the same technical characteristics and are perfect for building low-rise houses. They have more precise geometrical dimensions, which affects the thickness of the masonry joints, the consumption of expensive masonry mortar, the thermal conductivity of the wall taking into account the masonry mortar, and the complexity of laying. For comparison: the thickness of the masonry for gas concrete blocks is 1-1.5 mm, while for ceramic bricks, the thickness of the masonry will vary from 10 to 15 mm.</p>

                        <p>Slag blocks are also considered to be inexpensive building materials, however, due to their high thermal conductivity, the walls erected from them require additional insulation. In addition, slag blocks have a large weight. These disadvantages explain why consumers prefer expanded clay concrete blocks.</p>

                        <h1>Aerated concrete</h1>
                        <p>
                            Aerated concrete is made from a mixture of wood chips, cement solution, and special additives. The material is lightweight and warm according to technical characteristics. It is suitable for the construction of low-rise houses. The elasticity of aerated concrete allows it to withstand floor slabs.

                        <p>One of the negative aspects of the material is frequent counterfeiting. Special equipment for the production of aerated concrete is not required, so homemade products often appear on the construction market. They add uncertified chemical additives to them. The technology is violated during production. As a result, a low-quality product is obtained.</p>
